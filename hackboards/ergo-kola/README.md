# Ergo-Kola

Planck-inspired ergonomic split keyboard.
Origonally I was going to design a different split keyboard (which i completed). However, after letting it sit for over a week, I decided that I was not yet statisfied with the final product. Some of these reasons are listed here:
- non-symetric layout
- Neopixels wired incorrectly
- Insane ammout of keys
- Not erginomic or intuitive

By keeping these in mind for my second revision, I was able to complete something that I am much more satisfied with!
